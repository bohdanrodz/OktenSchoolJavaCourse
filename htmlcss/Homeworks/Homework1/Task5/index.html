<h1>Batman (1989)</h1>
<hr>
<div class="plot">
    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist Vicki Vale investigate sightings of Batman, a masked vigilante fighting Gotham’s criminals. At a fundraiser hosted by
    billionaire Bruce Wayne (secretly Batman), Wayne becomes infatuated with Vale.</p>
    <p> Mob boss Carl Grissom sends his lieutenant Jack Napier to Axis Chemicals to retrieve evidence, secretly planning to have him killed for an affair with Grissom’s
    mistress. During the police raid, Napier kills corrupt Lt. Eckhardt but falls into a vat of chemicals. Surviving with disfigurements and driven insane, he becomes the
    Joker, murders Grissom, and takes over his operations.</p>


    <p>The Joker terrorizes Gotham by poisoning products with deadly Smylex gas. Obsessed with Vicki, he lures her to a museum. Batman rescues her and gives her evidence to
    stop Smylex. Later, as Wayne tries to reveal his identity, Joker interrupts and uses the phrase spoken by the mugger who killed Wayne’s parents, revealing himself as
    the killer.</p>

    <p>Joker plans to gas Gotham’s citizens during a parade, but Batman removes the balloons with his Batwing, which Joker shoots down. At the cathedral, Joker takes Vicki
    hostage. Batman confronts him, confirming that Napier created Batman by killing his parents. Batman attaches Joker to a gargoyle, causing him to fall to his
    death.</p>

    <p>Later, Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal. Batman leaves a message promising to protect Gotham. As Vicki waits for Bruce at Wayne Manor, Batman watches over
    the city from a rooftop.</p>

        <div class="about">
            <p>Michael Keaton (born Michael John Douglas, September 5, 1951, Pennsylvania) is an American actor known for his versatility across comedy,
            drama, and action. Early in his career, he worked as a TV cameraman before moving in front of the camera, appearing on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and sitcoms
            like Maude. To avoid confusion with Michael Douglas, he chose the stage name “Keaton.”</p>

            <p>He gained fame in comedies like Night Shift (1982), Mr. Mom (1983), and Beetlejuice (1988). His most iconic role came as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Tim Burton’s Batman
    (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), overcoming skepticism about casting a comedian as the Dark Knight.</p>

            <p>Through the 1990s, Keaton balanced varied roles: a villain in Pacific Heights (1990), a cop in One Good Cop (1991), and appearances in Much Ado About Nothing, The
    Paper, Multiplicity, and Jackie Brown.</p>

            <p>In the 2000s, he voiced characters in Cars, Toy Story 3, and Minions, and acted in Live from Baghdad and Herbie: Fully Loaded.</p>

            <p>His career resurged with Birdman (2014), where he played an actor famous for a superhero role, earning him a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. He followed with
    acclaimed performances in Spotlight (2015) and The Founder (2016).</p>

            <p>Keaton is also a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
